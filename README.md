In thus porject we are trying to make a functional social networking application . where users can make their profile . 
they can make the posts which can be seen by other users . There are two modes one a is the community mode and 
other is the standard mode . anyone, who excels an expertise area by having the tag of Super Pro can enter in the community of elites for that area . 
Now his posts can only be seen by other community members of that area and he/she can see the posts those are uploaded on the community only . 
Where as on stamdard mode , its for general public . anyone can see anybody´s post . 
Also , if i post negative about some field for example : "football is a bad game " . the application itself gonna degrade my Fame level in football 
by next lower Fame . Also if you reach lowest Fame and your Fame level can´t be decreased any furthure than you will be logged out immediately and 
can´t able to use the application ever again . On the other hand , your fame level get increased is you post some thing intellectual about a given field .
Every post is randomly given an expertise area by AI . 
For this application i have used the Django framework for ORM .
